<h1>Revising HTML and CSS</h1>
<p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated as WWW or W3,[1] commonly known as the Web) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks.</p>
<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="tagsimage.jpg" width="380" height="327">

<p>HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like &lt;html&gt;). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;;. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to style web pages and interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is a cornerstone specification of the web and almost all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation.</p>
